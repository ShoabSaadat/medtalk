I am trying to create an elegant looking flutter app which looks amazing in both mobile (for both android and ios) and web mode app that uses gemini's latest interactive api to chat with AI. User can go to /chat page with a beautiful interface that has a chat prompt input at the bottom with a send icon, and also has a call icon button for user to talk instead of writing into chat box if they want. For starters create an elegant looking landing page and chat page. Remember this is an app called MedTalk that allows medical students to talk to AI and get answers to their questions for passing exams.


The medtalk app has started to show the main page and chat page, create GEMINI_API_KEY env variable to load this key and then create the functionality for user to interactively chat with gemini using model "gemini-2.0-flash-exp". You can read more in flutter_gemini.txt or gemini_setup.txt or gemini_setup_example.txt files in docs folder to understand how to implement this feature. Dont implement audio / call feature yet, we will do that in next step.
